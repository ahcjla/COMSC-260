;Example of a while loop 

;Since the condition for a while loop is tested at the top of the loop,
;a while loop may not even execute once

.386      ;identifies minimum CPU for this program

.MODEL flat,stdcall    ;flat - protected mode program
                       ;stdcall - enables calling of MS_windows programs

;allocate memory for stack
;(default stack size for 32 bit implementation is 1MB without .STACK directive 
;  - default works for most situations)

.STACK 4096            ;allocate 4096 bytes (1000h) for stack
